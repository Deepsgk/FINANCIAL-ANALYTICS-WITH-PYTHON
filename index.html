  <h4>The zephyr tempt to bribe the winged,</h4>
    <h4> ecstasy finds its destination Far away in the empyrean. </h34>
   
  <h4> A wish remains unanswered </h4>
   <h4>to accept the invitation of the cajoling waves,</h4> 
   <h4>to its empire ruled by the finned where the sun denies to set. 
   
   Even to envy is the firefly who plays hide and seek with the dark.</h4>
   
   <h4> these fluvial desires could never meet the sea.</h4>
   <h4> to ostracise the rest and demarcate the ‘Perfect’ Out ;</h4> 
   <h4> bestowed the rights.</h4>
    <h4>For, Every creation of mine is a masterpiece says ‘The Almighty’.</h4>
   
    <h4>The nearest, who embraces whatever I gave and utilises it the best.</h4>
    <h4> one who enfolds the mystic spell of love and uplifts rest to explore contentment,</h4>
    <h4> Is on which I embark my autograph. </h4>
   
    <h4>Otiose deeds and words of sympathy take them away from me.</h4>
    <h4> For, never shower sympathy, if cannot rhyme deeds with words.</h4>
   
    <h4>The endearment becomes the greatest Enormity.</h4>
   
    <h4>Not to leave the ‘Perfect’ undefined</h4>
    <h4>‘I’the supreme establish </h4>
    <h4>He who lives beyond demarcation and Respect my every creation As Divine gift is </h4>
   <h4>‘The Perfect’.</h4>
